# KLWP Home Screen

My KLWP home screen.

[Showcase 1](showcase.webm?raw=1)  
[Showcase 2](parallax.webm?raw=1)

Requires Tasker to scrap PowerAMP info about current song, progress, etc. ([config](tasker.xml))

It also acts as a client for my [rust-notifier](https://github.com/funmaker/rust-notifier), to use it change the `url`
in global variables to your instance's URL. It could probably be tweaked to work with any rss feed.
